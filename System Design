Password Manager System Design Document
1. Introduction

The Password Manager System is designed to securely manage user passwords across multiple devices, ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and ease of use.
2. Architecture Overview
2.1 Components

    Web Application: Provides the main user interface for password management.
    Database Server: Stores user data, passwords, and system information.
    External Notification Service: Notifies users of events and triggers synchronization.

2.2 Interactions

    The Web Application communicates with the Database Server for user data.
    The External Notification Service is triggered by database events.

3. User Interface Design

The user interface follows a clean and intuitive design, allowing users to easily manage their passwords and settings.
4. Security Architecture
4.1 Encryption

    Passwords are stored using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
    Communication between the Web Application and Database Server is secured using TLS.

4.2 Authentication and Authorization

    User authentication is handled securely, ensuring only authorized access.
    Authorization mechanisms ensure users can only access their own passwords.

5. Database Design
5.1 Tables

    Users: Stores user information.
    Passwords: Stores encrypted password data along with associated metadata.

5.2 Relationships

    Establishes relationships between Users and Passwords tables.

6. Password Generation

The system generates strong, unique passwords using [algorithm/method]. Complexity and uniqueness are guaranteed.
7. Cross-Device Syncing

User passwords are synchronized securely across devices using [synchronization method]. Changes trigger updates through the External Notification Service.
8. Backup and Recovery

    Periodic backups are conducted to ensure data integrity.
    Users can recover their accounts or passwords through [recovery mechanism].

9. Logging and Auditing

    The system logs events for auditing purposes, accessible by administrators.
    Logs capture user actions, system events, and security-related activities.

10. Scalability and Performance

The system is designed to scale horizontally to accommodate a growing number of users and passwords. [Details on optimization strategies].
11. Notification System

Users receive notifications for password changes or potential security issues through the External Notification Service.
12. Integration with Browser Extensions

The system seamlessly integrates with browser extensions to enhance user experience and functionality.
13. Future Expansion and Maintenance

    The system is designed to support future features, with an extensible architecture.
    Maintenance and updates are facilitated through [maintenance strategies].
